Please download the model ```best_model_alex.pth``` we have trained from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FYCPo4fLVlf1l_GMvk_ABhMpD4hhDEId)

The model is trained based on image data gathered in the workstation, for the Robotic Event Day, it is highly recommended to re-collect the dataset at the vent venue to see if the model works well. 

It is planned for the participants to collect their own image data (recommended to have more than 100 images for both ```free``` and ```blocked```) during the event, but do try out on your own before to make sure everything works fine!
